        "Ans -\n",
        "- Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to quantify and describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how much the data values deviate from the central tendency and give an indication of how spread out or clustered the data points are. Here's how these measures are used:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a basic understanding of the spread by giving the interval over which the data values vary. However, it does not consider the distribution of values between the minimum and maximum, so it can be influenced by outliers.\n",
        "Example: Let's say we have a dataset representing the ages of individuals in a group: [20, 25, 22, 30, 28]. The range would be the difference between the maximum and minimum values: 30 - 20 = 10. This means the age values span a range of 10 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a more detailed understanding of the spread by taking into account the differences between individual data points and the mean. A higher variance indicates greater dispersion.\n",
        " - Example: Using the same age dataset as before, let's calculate the variance:\n",
        "First, find the mean: (20 + 25 + 22 + 30 + 28) / 5 = 25.\n",
        "Then, calculate the squared deviation for each value: (20-25)^2, (25-25)^2, (22-25)^2, (30-25)^2, (28-25)^2.\n",
        "Sum up the squared deviations: (5^2 + 0^2 + (-3)^2 + 5^2 + 3^2) = 74.\n",
        "Finally, divide the sum by the total number of values (5) to get the variance: 74 / 5 = 14.8.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of dispersion that is on the same scale as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability or spread in the dataset.\n",
        " - Example: Using the same age dataset, the variance was calculated as 14.8. To find the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance: √14.8 ≈ 3.85."

It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes, where each circle represents a set, and the overlapping areas represent the elements that are shared between the sets.\n",

        "Venn diagrams are named after the English logician and philosopher John Venn, who introduced them in the late 19th century.
