A thread is a lightweight subprocess or a separate flow of execution within a program. Multithreading allows different parts of a program to run concurrently, which can improve overall performance and responsiveness."

The code written inside the run method will be executed when the thread is started using the start method.\n",

When you invoke the start method, a new thread is created and its run method is executed concurrently with the main thread (or other threads). The start method ensures that the thread runs asynchronously and independently.\n",
